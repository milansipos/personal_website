            <p>
                I am a 21 year old Student at the Technical University of Munich. I was born in Hungary where I visited a german high school for 5 years and did the german "Abitur". I am in my third semester studying computer science here in Munich. Since October 2025 I am working on the side as a software developer for the bavarian company "BlueCatBio". I am very interested in everything tech-related, let it be hardware or software.
